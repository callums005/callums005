## Unity <-> Arduino Communication 
[Github Project Link](https://github.com/callums005/unity-arduino-communication)<br />
After wanting to create a custom controller for a flight-simulator I stumbled across the idea of using an arduino to communicate between unity and the micro-controller. I found a few solutions however none of them worked for me, so I decided to write my own script to take input from the arduino and send data from unity to the arduino using the IO.Ports functionallity within C#.
